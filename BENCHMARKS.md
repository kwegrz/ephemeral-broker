# Performance Benchmarks

This document describes the performance characteristics of ephemeral-broker and how to run benchmarks.

## Quick Results

Tested on Apple M1 Max, Node.js v22.17.0:

| Operation | Ops/sec | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| SET       | 12,285  | 0        | 1        | 1        |
| GET       | 26,882  | 0        | 0        | 1        |
| DEL       | 26,042  | 0        | 0        | 1        |
| PING      | 27,027  | 0        | 0        | 1        |

**Memory Usage:**

- ~1,566 bytes per item (10,000 items stored)
- 14.93 MB heap increase
- 19.31 MB RSS increase

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
node benchmark/perf.js
```

The benchmark script will:

1. Warm up with 100 operations
2. Run 5,000 operations for each command (SET, GET, DEL, PING)
3. Measure memory usage by storing 10,000 items
4. Output detailed results including latency percentiles

## Interpreting Results

### Operations Per Second (ops/sec)

This measures throughput - how many operations can be completed per second.

- **SET**: Write operations (key/value storage with TTL)
- **GET**: Read operations (retrieve value by key)
- **DEL**: Delete operations (remove key)
- **PING**: Health check operations (no data transfer)

Higher is better. READ operations (GET, PING) are typically 2-3x faster than WRITE operations (SET) due to no serialization overhead.

### Latency Percentiles

Latency measures how long individual operations take:

- **P50 (median)**: 50% of operations complete within this time
- **P95**: 95% of operations complete within this time
- **P99**: 99% of operations complete within this time

Lower is better. Sub-millisecond latency is typical for IPC over Unix domain sockets.

### Memory Usage

Memory usage depends on:

- **Value size**: Larger values consume more heap
- **Number of items**: Each item has storage overhead (key, value, TTL metadata)
- **Compression**: Enabled by default, reduces memory for large values

**Bytes per item** shows average memory cost per stored key-value pair.

## Performance Characteristics

### Why is GET faster than SET?

**SET operations** must:

1. Serialize value to JSON
2. Store in Map with metadata
3. Schedule TTL expiration
4. Send acknowledgment

**GET operations** only:

1. Lookup in Map
2. Check TTL expiration
3. Serialize and send value

### Unix Domain Sockets vs TCP

Ephemeral-broker uses Unix domain sockets (named pipes), which are:

- **Faster**: No network stack overhead
- **More secure**: Filesystem permissions (0700)
- **Same-host only**: Cannot connect remotely

This makes it ideal for parallel test coordination where all workers run on the same machine.

### Memory Overhead

Each stored item includes:

- **Key string**: Variable size
- **Value data**: Serialized JSON
- **Expires timestamp**: 8 bytes (Number)
- **Map overhead**: ~40-50 bytes per entry

Typical overhead is **~1,500-2,000 bytes per item** for small values (100 bytes).

### Scaling Limits

Default limits (configurable):

- **maxItems**: 10,000 items
- **maxValueSize**: 256 KB per value
- **maxRequestSize**: 1 MB per request

These prevent memory exhaustion. For production use:

- Monitor with `client.stats()` to track item count and memory
- Set appropriate `maxItems` based on your workload
- Use TTLs to auto-expire old data

## Optimizing Performance

### 1. Batch Operations

Instead of:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  await client.set(`key${i}`, value)
}
```

Use:

```javascript
await Promise.all(Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => client.set(`key${i}`, value)))
```

Parallel requests are 5-10x faster.

### 2. Disable Debug Logging

Debug mode adds ~10-20% overhead:

```javascript
const broker = new Broker({ debug: false })
const client = new Client(pipe, { debug: false })
```

### 3. Connection Pooling

Create one client per worker, reuse connections:

```javascript
// In worker setup
const client = new Client(process.env.EPHEMERAL_PIPE)

// Reuse client for all operations
await client.set('key1', 'value1')
await client.get('key2')
```

### 4. Compression

Enabled by default for values >1KB. Disable for small values:

```javascript
const broker = new Broker({ compression: false })
```

### 5. Sweeper Interval

Default TTL sweeper runs every 30 seconds. Increase for less overhead:

```javascript
const broker = new Broker({ sweeperInterval: 60000 }) // 60s
```

## Benchmarking Your Setup

To test on your own hardware:

```bash
node benchmark/perf.js
```

Expected performance ranges:

- **Laptop (M1/M2)**: 10-15k SET ops/sec, 25-30k GET ops/sec
- **Desktop (Ryzen/Intel)**: 8-12k SET ops/sec, 20-25k GET ops/sec
- **CI/Cloud VM**: 5-10k SET ops/sec, 15-20k GET ops/sec

Performance varies by:

- CPU speed
- Disk I/O (Unix socket filesystem)
- System load
- Node.js version

## Comparing to Alternatives

### vs Redis (TCP)

Ephemeral-broker is:

- ✅ **Faster** for same-host IPC (no network stack)
- ✅ **Simpler** (no daemon, no install)
- ✅ **Zero config** (random pipe names)
- ❌ **No persistence** (in-memory only)
- ❌ **No clustering** (single process)

Use ephemeral-broker for test coordination. Use Redis for production caching.

### vs Filesystem

Ephemeral-broker is:

- ✅ **Faster** (no disk I/O)
- ✅ **Safer** (no secrets on disk)
- ✅ **Cleaner** (auto-cleanup on exit)
- ✅ **Atomic** (lease/release operations)

Use ephemeral-broker instead of temp files for test state.

### vs Shared Memory

Ephemeral-broker is:

- ✅ **Simpler** (no native modules)
- ✅ **Cross-platform** (Windows + Unix)
- ✅ **Type-safe** (JSON serialization)
- ❌ **Slower** (serialization overhead)

Use ephemeral-broker for structured data. Use shared memory for raw buffers.

## Profiling and Debugging

### Enable Debug Mode

```javascript
const broker = new Broker({ debug: true })
```

Shows:

- Client connections/disconnections
- Request/response cycles
- TTL expirations
- Store operations

### Monitor Stats

```javascript
const stats = await client.stats()
console.log('Items:', stats.items)
console.log('Memory:', stats.memory.heapUsed)
console.log('Uptime:', stats.uptime)
```

### Trace Latency

Add timing to your code:

```javascript
const start = Date.now()
await client.set('key', 'value')
console.log('SET latency:', Date.now() - start, 'ms')
```

Typical latency: <1ms for local IPC.
